Q & A 96
Q. What is God’s will for us
in the second commandment?

A. That we in no way make any image of God1
nor worship him in any other way

than has been commanded in God’s Word.2

1 Deut. 4:15-19; Isa. 40:18-25; Acts 17:29; Rom. 1:22-23
2 Lev. 10:1-7; 1 Sam. 15:22-23; John 4:23-24

Q & A 97
Q. May we then not make
any image at all?

A. God can not and may not
be visibly portrayed in any way.

Although creatures may be portrayed,
yet God forbids making or having such images

if one’s intention is to worship them
or to serve God through them.1

1 Ex. 34:13-14, 17; 2 Kings 18:4-5

Q & A 98
Q. But may not images be permitted in churches
in place of books for the unlearned?

A. No, we should not try to be wiser than God.
God wants the Christian community instructed

by the living preaching of his Word—1
not by idols that cannot even talk.2

1 Rom. 10:14-15, 17; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:19
2 Jer. 10:8; Hab. 2:18-20
