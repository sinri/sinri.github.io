## 第三十七问

Q. What do you understand by the word “suffered”?

你是怎么理解“受难”一词的？

---

A. That during his whole life on earth,
but especially at the end,
Christ sustained in body and soul
the wrath of God against the sin of the whole human race. [1]
This he did in order that,
by his suffering as the only atoning sacrifice, [2]
he might deliver us, body and soul, from eternal condemnation,[3]
and gain for us God’s grace, righteousness, and eternal life. [4]

在祂整个地上的人生中，尤其是在末了，基督在身体灵魂中承受了神对全人类罪的愤怒[1]。
祂如此行是为了通过祂的受难作为唯一的赎罪祭[2]，
祂能拯救我们的身体和灵魂出离永远的定罪[3]，
并为我们获得神的恩典、义和永生[4]。

## 第三十八问

Q. Why did he suffer “under Pontius Pilate” as judge?

祂为何是“在本丢彼拉多手下”受难呢？

---

A. So that he, though innocent, might be condemned by an earthly judge, [1]
and so free us from the severe judgment of God that was to fall on us. [2]

这样尽管祂是无罪的，得以被属地的审判所定罪[1]，
并救我们脱离那将会临到我们的神的可怕的审判[2]。

## 第三十九问

Q. Is it significant that he was “crucified” instead of dying some other way?

祂被“钉在十字架上”，相对于其他死法，这有什么特别的意义吗？

---

A. Yes.

By this I am convinced
that he shouldered the curse
which lay on me,
since death by crucifixion was cursed by God. [1]

有。

因此我就确信，祂担当了我所当负的咒诅，因为凡挂在木头上的死都是被神咒诅的。[1]
