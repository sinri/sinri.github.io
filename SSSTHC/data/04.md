Q & A 9
Q. But doesn’t God do us an injustice
by requiring in his law
what we are unable to do?

A. No, God created human beings with the ability to keep the law.1
They, however, provoked by the devil,2

in willful disobedience,3
robbed themselves and all their descendants of these gifts.4

2 Gen. 3:13; John 8:44
3 Gen. 3:6
4 Rom. 5:12, 18, 19

Q & A 10
Q. Does God permit
such disobedience and rebellion
to go unpunished?

A. Certainly not.
God is terribly angry

with the sin we are born with
as well as the sins we personally commit.

As a just judge,
God will punish them both now and in eternity,1
having declared:

“Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey
all the things written in the book of the law.”2

2 Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26

Q & A 11
Q. But isn’t God also merciful?

A. God is certainly merciful,1
but also just.2
God’s justice demands

that sin, committed against his supreme majesty,
be punished with the supreme penalty—
eternal punishment of body and soul.3

2 Ex. 34:7; Deut. 7:9-11; Ps. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:30-31
