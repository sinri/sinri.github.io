## 第九问

Q. But doesn’t God do us an injustice by requiring in his law what we are unable to do?

神在祂的律法中要求我们的既然是我们不能行的，这岂不是祂行得不义吗？

---

A. No, God created human beings with the ability to keep the law.[1]

They, however, provoked by the devil,[2] in willful disobedience,[3] robbed themselves and all their descendants of these gifts.[4]

不，神创造人的时候给了人完全遵行律法的能力。[1]

然而他们被魔鬼诱惑，[2]
在出于自愿的悖逆中，[3]
使得他们和所有他们的后裔都失去了这些恩赐。[4]

## 第十问

Q. Does God permit such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?

神放任这样的不顺服和悖逆不受惩治吗？

---

A. Certainly not.

God is terribly angry
with the sin we are born with
as well as the sins we personally commit.

As a just judge,
God will punish them both now and in eternity, [1]
having declared:

> “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey
all the things written in the book of the law.” [2]

绝不。

神极其愤怒于我们生而有的罪，并我们自身犯下的诸罪。
作为一个公义的审判者，神在今生在永恒都施行惩罚，[1]
并宣言说：

> 凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。[2]

2 Gal. 3:10; Deut. 27:26

## 第十一问

Q. But isn’t God also merciful?

神岂不也是有恩慈的吗？

---

A. God is certainly merciful, [1] but also just. [2] God’s justice demands that sin, committed against his supreme majesty, be punished with the supreme penalty - eternal punishment of body and soul. [3]

神确乎是有恩慈的，但也是公义的。[2]神的公义要求那些干犯至高之神的罪都要加以最高的报应，就是身体和灵魂所受的永远刑罚。[3]
