# 第31个主日 第二部分 耶稣基督的神圣晚餐

## 第八十三问

Q. What are the keys of the kingdom?

天国的钥匙是什么？

---

A. The preaching of the holy gospel
and Christian discipline toward repentance.
Both of them
open the kingdom of heaven to believers
and close it to unbelievers. [1]

宣讲神圣福音以及要求悔改的教内惩戒。
两者是将天国向信者打开，并向不信之人关闭。[1]

## 第八十四问

Q. How does preaching the holy gospel
open and close the kingdom of heaven?

宣讲神圣福音是如何开关天国的门的？

A. According to the command of Christ:
The kingdom of heaven is opened
by proclaiming and publicly declaring
to all believers, each and every one, that,
as often as they accept the gospel promise in true faith,
God, because of Christ’s merit,
truly forgives all their sins.
The kingdom of heaven is closed, however,
by proclaiming and publicly declaring
to unbelievers and hypocrites that,
as long as they do not repent,
the wrath of God and eternal condemnation
rest on them.
God’s judgment, both in this life and in the life to come,
is based on this gospel testimony.[1]

照着基督的命令，天国的门要藉着要向一切信徒一一宣讲并公开见证福音而打开；
这福音就是只要他们用真信心接受福音的应许，神就要因基督的赎罪赦免他们一切的罪。
反之，关闭天国的门也是如此向一切不信的和假冒为善的人宣告，
如果他们仍不悔改归正，上帝的震怒和永远的定罪就常在他们身上。
神是照这这福音的见证，在今生和来世施行审判。[1]

## 第八十五问

Q. How is the kingdom of heaven
closed and opened by Christian discipline?

教内惩戒是如何开关天国的门的？

---

A. According to the command of Christ:
Those who, though called Christians,
profess unchristian teachings or live unchristian lives,
and who after repeated personal and loving admonitions,
refuse to abandon their errors and evil ways,
and who after being reported to the church, that is,
to those ordained by the church for that purpose,
fail to respond also to the church’s admonitions—
such persons the church excludes
from the Christian community
by withholding the sacraments from them,
and God also excludes them from the kingdom of Christ. [1]
Such persons,
when promising and demonstrating genuine reform,
are received again
as members of Christ
and of his church. [2]

照基督的吩咐，若有称为基督徒的，宣言异端教训，或生活失去基督徒的体统，
经过多次私下因爱而发的告诫，仍然拒绝离弃他们的错谬和恶途，就当告诉教会，
即向教会中治理的长老们告发，若他仍然藐视不听教会的告诫，
便由教会通过在圣礼上拒绝他而把他逐出教会交通，同时神也把他置于于基督的国度置外[1]；
但若他保证并实际真实悔改归正，便可重新接纳他作为基督及其教会的肢体[2]。
