Q & A 120
Q. Why did Christ command us
to call God “our Father”?

A. To awaken in us
at the very beginning of our prayer
what should be basic to our prayer—

a childlike reverence and trust
that through Christ God has become our Father,

and that just as our parents do not refuse us

the things of this life,

even less will God our Father refuse to give us

what we ask in faith.1

1 Matt. 7:9-11; Luke 11:11-13

Q & A 121
Q. Why the words
“in heaven”?

A. These words teach us

not to think of God’s heavenly majesty

as something earthly,1

and to expect everything

needed for body and soul
from God’s almighty power.2

1 Jer. 23:23-24; Acts 17:24-25
2 Matt. 6:25-34; Rom. 8:31-32
