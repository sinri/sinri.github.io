## 第三十一问

Q. Why is he called “Christ,” meaning “anointed”?

为何祂被称为基督，意为受膏者？

---

A. Because he has been ordained by God the Father
and has been anointed with the Holy Spirit [1]
to be our chief  prophetand teacher [2]
who fully reveals to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our deliverance; [3]
our only high priest [4]
who has delivered us by the one sacrifice of his body, [5]
and who continually pleads our cause with the Father; [6]
and our eternal king [7]
who governs us by his Word and Spirit,
and who guards us and keeps us in the freedom he has won for us. [8]

因为祂已经被父神所膏立，并未圣灵所膏[1]，
要成为我们的最大的先知和教师[2]来将神关于我们得救的奥秘的计划和心意启示我们；[3]
也成为我们唯一的大祭司[4]，将自己的身体一次献上来释放我们[5]，并且为我们的过犯不断在父面前代求[6]；
祂也作我们永恒的君王[7]，以祂的道和灵管治我们，并保护我们，保守我们在祂为我们赢得的自由中[8]。

## 第三十二问

Q. But why are you called a Christian?

那么你为什么被称为一名基督徒？

---

A. Because by faith I am a member of Christ [1]
and so I share in his anointing. [2]

因为我因信已经成为基督的肢体[1]，因此我也有份于祂的膏立[2]。

I am anointed to confess his name, [3]
to present myself to him as a living sacrifice of thanks, [4]
to strive with a free conscience against sin and the devil in this life, [5]
and afterward to reign with Christ over all creation for eternity. [6]

我被膏立以认祂名[3]，并将自己献给祂作为感恩的活祭[4]，
并在此生以自由的良心与罪和魔鬼抗争[5]，
并在将来要和基督一同作王，永远掌权于万有之上[6]。
