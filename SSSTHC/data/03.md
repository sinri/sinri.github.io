Q & A 6
Q. Did God create people
so wicked and perverse?

A. No.
God created them good1 and in his own image,2

that is, in true righteousness and holiness,3

so that they might

truly know God their creator,4
love him with all their heart,
and live with God in eternal happiness,

to praise and glorify him.5
