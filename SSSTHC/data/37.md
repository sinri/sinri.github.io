Q & A 101
Q. But may we swear an oath in God’s name
if we do it reverently?

A. Yes, when the government demands it,
or when necessity requires it,

in order to maintain and promote truth and trustworthiness
for God’s glory and our neighbor’s good.

Such oaths are grounded in God’s Word1

and were rightly used by the people of God

in the Old and New Testaments.2

1 Deut. 6:13; 10:20; Jer. 4:1-2; Heb. 6:16
2 Gen. 21:24; Josh. 9:15; 1 Kings 1:29-30; Rom. 1:9; 2 Cor. 1:23

Q & A 102
Q. May we also swear by saints or other creatures?

A. No.
A legitimate oath means calling upon God
as the only one who knows my heart

to witness to my truthfulness
and to punish me if I swear falsely.1

No creature is worthy of such honor.2

1 Rom. 9:1; 2 Cor. 1:23
2 Matt. 5:34-37; 23:16-22; James 5:12
