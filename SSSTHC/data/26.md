# 第26个主日 第二部分 圣浸礼

## 第六十九问

Q. How does holy baptism remind and assure you
that Christ’s one sacrifice on the cross benefits you personally?

神圣的浸礼是如何提醒并确保基督在十字架上的一次救赎给你个人带来益处的？

---

A. In this way:
Christ instituted this outward washing [1]
and with it promised that,
as surely as water washes away the dirt from the body,
so certainly his blood and his Spirit
wash away my soul’s impurity,
that is, all my sins. [2]

如此：
基督指定了外在的水礼[1]，并且应许说，正如这水洗去人身体的污秽，
祂的血和祂的灵也洗去我们灵魂的不洁，也就是我所有的罪[2]。

## 第七十问

Q. What does it mean to be washed with Christ’s blood and Spirit?

以基督的血和灵洗净是什么意思？

---

A. To be washed with Christ’s blood means
that God, by grace, has forgiven our sins
because of Christ’s blood
poured out for us in his sacrifice on the cross. [1]
To be washed with Christ’s Spirit means
that the Holy Spirit has renewed
and sanctified us to be members of Christ,
so that more and more we become dead to sin
and live holy and blameless lives. [2]

被基督的宝血洗净，就是神出于恩典，因基督在十字架上为我们牺牲所倾倒出的宝血，已经赦免我们的罪[1]；
被基督的灵洗净，就是我们已经被圣灵更新并且分别为圣作基督的肢体，以至于我们越来越多地向罪而死，过圣洁无有瑕疵的生活[2]。

## 第七十一问

Q. Where does Christ promise
that we are washed with his blood and Spirit
as surely as we are washed
with the water of baptism?

基督在何处应许我们要被祂的血和灵洗净正如我们被浸礼的水洗净一样？

---

A. In the institution of baptism, where he says:
“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.” [1]

“The one who believes and is baptized will be saved;
but the one who does not believe will be condemned.” [2]

This promise is repeated when Scripture calls baptism
“the water of rebirth” [3] and
the washing away of sins. [4]

在设立浸礼的时候，祂说：
“所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。”[1]
“信而受洗的必然得救；不信的必被定罪。”[2]
在圣经中提到浸礼时也描述说“重生的洗”[3]，以及提到藉着浸礼“洗去罪”[4]。
