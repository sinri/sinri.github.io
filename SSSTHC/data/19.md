Q & A 50
Q. Why the next words:
“and is seated at the right hand of God”?

A. Because Christ ascended to heaven
to show there that he is head of his church,1

the one through whom the Father rules all things.2

Q & A 51
Q. How does this glory of Christ our head
benefit us?

A. First, through his Holy Spirit

he pours out gifts from heaven

upon us his members.1

Second, by his power

he defends us and keeps us safe

from all enemies.2

Q & A 52
Q. How does Christ’s return
“to judge the living and the dead”
comfort you?

A. In all distress and persecution,
with uplifted head,
I confidently await the very judge

who has already offered himself to the judgment of God
in my place and removed the whole curse from me.1

Christ will cast all his enemies and mine

into everlasting condemnation,

but will take me and all his chosen ones

to himself
into the joy and glory of heaven.2
