Q & A 103
Q. What is God’s will for you
in the fourth commandment?

A. First,

that the gospel ministry and education for it be maintained,1
and that, especially on the festive day of rest,
I diligently attend the assembly of God’s people2

to learn what God’s Word teaches,3
to participate in the sacraments,4
to pray to God publicly,5
and to bring Christian offerings for the poor.6

Second,

that every day of my life

I rest from my evil ways,
let the Lord work in me through his Spirit,

and so begin in this life
the eternal Sabbath.7
