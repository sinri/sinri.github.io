Q & A 20
Q. Are all people then saved through Christ
just as they were lost through Adam?

A. No.
Only those are saved
who through true faith

are grafted into Christ
and accept all his benefits.1

1 Matt. 7:14; John 3:16, 18, 36; Rom. 11:16-21

Q & A 21
Q. What is true faith?

A. True faith is
not only a sure knowledge by which I hold as true

all that God has revealed to us in Scripture;1

it is also a wholehearted trust,2

which the Holy Spirit creates in me3 by the gospel,4
that God has freely granted,

not only to others but to me also,5

forgiveness of sins,
eternal righteousness,
and salvation.6

These are gifts of sheer grace,
granted solely by Christ’s merit.7

Q & A 22
Q. What then must a Christian believe?

A. All that is promised us in the gospel,1

a summary of which is taught us
in the articles of our universal
and undisputed Christian faith.

1 Matt. 28:18-20; John 20:30-31

Q & A 23
Q. What are these articles?

A. I believe in God, the Father almighty,

creator of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord,

who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
and born of the virgin Mary.
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died, and was buried;
he descended to hell.
The third day he rose again from the dead.
He ascended to heaven
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,

the holy catholic church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting. Amen.
