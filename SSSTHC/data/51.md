Q & A 126
Q. What does the fifth petition mean?

A. “Forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors” means:

Because of Christ’s blood,
do not hold against us, poor sinners that we are,

any of the sins we do
or the evil that constantly clings to us.1

Forgive us just as we are fully determined,

as evidence of your grace in us,

to forgive our neighbors.2
