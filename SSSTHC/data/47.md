Q & A 122
Q. What does the first petition mean?

A. “Hallowed be your name” means:

Help us to truly know you,1
to honor, glorify, and praise you

for all your works
and for all that shines forth from them:

your almighty power, wisdom, kindness,
justice, mercy, and truth.2

And it means,

Help us to direct all our living—

what we think, say, and do—

so that your name will never be blasphemed because of us
but always honored and praised.3
