Q & A 45
Q. How does Christ’s resurrection
benefit us?

A. First, by his resurrection he has overcome death,

so that he might make us share in the righteousness
he obtained for us by his death.1

Second, by his power we too

are already raised to a new life.2

Third, Christ’s resurrection

is a sure pledge to us of our blessed resurrection.3
