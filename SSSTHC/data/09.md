Q. What do you believe when you say,
“I believe in God, the Father almighty,
creator of heaven and earth”?

A. That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

who out of nothing created heaven and earth

and everything in them,1

who still upholds and rules them

by his eternal counsel and providence,2

is my God and Father

because of Christ the Son.3

I trust God so much that I do not doubt

he will provide

whatever I need
for body and soul,4

and will turn to my good

whatever adversity he sends upon me
in this sad world.5

God is able to do this because he is almighty God6
and desires to do this because he is a faithful Father.7
