Q & A 123
Q. What does the second petition mean?

A. “Your kingdom come” means:
Rule us by your Word and Spirit in such a way

that more and more we submit to you.1

Preserve your church and make it grow.2

Destroy the devil’s work;
destroy every force which revolts against you
and every conspiracy against your holy Word.3

Do this until your kingdom fully comes,

when you will be

all in all.4
