Q & A 112
Q. What is the aim of the ninth commandment?

A. That I

never give false testimony against anyone,
twist no one’s words,
not gossip or slander,
nor join in condemning anyone
rashly or without a hearing.1

Rather, in court and everywhere else,
I should avoid lying and deceit of every kind;

these are the very devices the devil uses,
and they would call down on me God’s intense wrath.2

I should love the truth,

speak it candidly,
and openly acknowledge it.3

And I should do what I can

to guard and advance my neighbor’s good name.4
