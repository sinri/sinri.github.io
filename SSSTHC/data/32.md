Q & A 86
Q. Since we have been delivered
from our misery
by grace through Christ
without any merit of our own,
why then should we do good works?

A. Because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood,
is also restoring us by his Spirit into his image,

so that with our whole lives

we may show that we are thankful to God

for his benefits,1

so that he may be praised through us,2
so that we may be assured of our faith by its fruits,3
and so that by our godly living

our neighbors may be won over to Christ.4

Q & A 87
Q. Can those be saved
who do not turn to God
from their ungrateful
and unrepentant ways?

A. By no means.
Scripture tells us that

no unchaste person,
no idolater, adulterer, thief,
no covetous person,
no drunkard, slanderer, robber,
or the like
will inherit the kingdom of God.1

1 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:1-20; 1 John 3:14
