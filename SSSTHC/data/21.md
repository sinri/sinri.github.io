Q & A 54
Q. What do you believe
concerning “the holy catholic church”?

A. I believe that the Son of God

through his Spirit and Word,1
out of the entire human race,2
from the beginning of the world to its end,3

gathers, protects, and preserves for himself

a community chosen for eternal life4

and united in true faith.5

And of this community I am6 and always will be7

a living member.

Q & A 55
Q. What do you understand by
“the communion of saints”?

A. First, that believers one and all,
as members of this community,
share in Christ
and in all his treasures and gifts.1

Second, that each member
should consider it a duty
to use these gifts
readily and joyfully
for the service and enrichment

of the other members.2

Q & A 56
Q. What do you believe
concerning “the forgiveness of sins”?

A. I believe that God,

because of Christ’s satisfaction,

will no longer remember

any of my sins1
or my sinful nature

which I need to struggle against all my life.2

Rather, by grace

God grants me the righteousness of Christ
to free me forever from judgment.3
