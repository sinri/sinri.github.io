Q & A 29
Q. Why is the Son of God called “Jesus,”
meaning “savior”?

A. Because he saves us from our sins,1

and because salvation should not be sought
and cannot be found in anyone else.2

1 Matt. 1:21; Heb. 7:25
2 Isa. 43:11; John 15:5; Acts 4:11-12; 1 Tim. 2:5

Q & A 30
Q. Do those who look for
their salvation in saints,
in themselves, or elsewhere
really believe in the only savior Jesus?

A. No.
Although they boast of being his,
by their actions they deny
the only savior, Jesus.1

Either Jesus is not a perfect savior,
or those who in true faith accept this savior
have in him all they need for their salvation.2

1 1 Cor. 1:12-13; Gal. 5:4
2 Col. 1:19-20; 2:10; 1 John 1:7
