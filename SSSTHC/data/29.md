# 第29个主日 第二部分 耶稣基督的神圣晚餐

## 第七十八问

Q. Do the bread and wine become
the real body and blood of Christ?

这饼和杯真的变成了基督的身体和血吗？

---

A. No.
Just as the water of baptism
is not changed into Christ’s blood
and does not itself wash away sins
but is simply a divine sign and assurance [1] of these things,
so too the holy bread of the Lord’s Supper
does not become the actual body of Christ, [2]
even though it is called the body of Christ [3]
in keeping with the nature and language of sacraments. [4]

不。正如浸礼的水并没有变成基督的血，这水本身也没有洗去罪，简明而言，只是这些事的一个神圣标记和保证[1]；
同样，主的晚餐的神圣之饼也没有变成真正的基督的身体[2]，虽然如此，它被称为基督的身体[3]，
在于圣礼的本质和表达[4]。

## 第七十九问

Q. Why then does Christ call
the bread his body
and the cup his blood,
or the new covenant in his blood,
and Paul use the words,
a sharing in Christ’s body and blood?

为什么基督称这饼为祂的身体、称这杯为祂的血、是祂用血所立的新约；并且使徒保罗也说同领基督的身体和血呢？

---

A. Christ has good reason for these words.
He wants to teach us that
just as bread and wine nourish the temporal life,
so too his crucified body and poured-out blood
are the true food and drink of our souls for eternal life. [1]
But more important,
he wants to assure us, by this visible sign and pledge,
that we, through the Holy Spirit’s work,
share in his true body and blood
as surely as our mouths
receive these holy signs in his remembrance, [2]
and that all of his suffering and obedience
are as definitely ours
as if we personally
had suffered and made satisfaction for our sins. [3]

基督这样说有重大的原因。
祂藉此教训我们，正如饼和杯维持今世的生命，祂被钉的身体和流出来的宝血，也是我们灵魂至于永生的真正饮食[1]。
更重要的是，祂要用这可见的标记和保证叫我们在圣灵的工作之中有份于祂的真实身体和血，正如我们的口接受这神圣记号为记念[2]；
而且，祂一切的苦难和顺服也确实地成为我们的，好像我们自己受了苦、为我们的罪向神付出赎价了一样[3]。
