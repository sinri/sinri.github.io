# 第30个主日 第二部分 耶稣基督的神圣晚餐

Q & A 80*
Q. How does the Lord’s Supper
differ from the Roman Catholic Mass?

A. The Lord’s Supper declares to us

that all our sins are completely forgiven
through the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
which he himself accomplished on the cross once for all.1

It also declares to us

that the Holy Spirit grafts us into Christ,2
who with his true body
is now in heaven at the right hand of the Father3
where he wants us to worship him.4

[But the Mass teaches

that the living and the dead
do not have their sins forgiven
through the suffering of Christ
unless Christ is still offered for them daily by the priests.

It also teaches

that Christ is bodily present
under the form of bread and wine
where Christ is therefore to be worshiped.

Thus the Mass is basically

nothing but a denial
of the one sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ
and a condemnable idolatry.]**

*Q&A 80 was altogether absent from the first edition of the catechism but was present in a shorter form in the second edition. The translation here given is of the expanded text of the third edition.

**In response to a mandate from Synod 1998, the Christian Reformed Church’s Interchurch Relations Committee conducted a study of Q&A 80 and the Roman Catholic Mass. Based on this study, Synod 2004 declared that “Q&A 80 can no longer be held in its current form as part of our confession.” Synod 2006 directed that Q&A 80 remain in the CRC’s text of the Heidelberg Catechism but that the last three paragraphs be placed in brackets to indicate that they do not accurately reflect the official teaching and practice of today’s Roman Catholic Church and are no longer confessionally binding on members of the CRC.

The Reformed Church in America retains the original full text, choosing to recognize that the catechism was written within a historical context which may not accurately describe the Roman Catholic Church’s current stance.

Q & A 81
Q. Who should come
to the Lord’s table?

A. Those who are displeased with themselves

because of their sins,

but who nevertheless trust

that their sins are pardoned
and that their remaining weakness is covered

by the suffering and death of Christ,

and who also desire more and more

to strengthen their faith
and to lead a better life.

Hypocrites and those who are unrepentant, however,
eat and drink judgment on themselves.1

1 1 Cor. 10:19-22; 11:26-32

Q & A 82
Q. Should those be admitted
to the Lord’s Supper
who show by what they profess and how they live
that they are unbelieving and ungodly?

A. No, that would dishonor God’s covenant
and bring down God’s wrath upon the entire congregation.1
Therefore, according to the instruction of Christ

and his apostles,

the Christian church is duty-bound to exclude such people,

by the official use of the keys of the kingdom,

until they reform their lives.

1 1 Cor. 11:17-32; Ps. 50:14-16; Isa. 1:11-17
