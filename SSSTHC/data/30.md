Q. How does the Lord’s Supper
differ from the Roman Catholic Mass?

主的晚餐是如何区别于罗马天主教的弥撒的？

---

A. The Lord’s Supper declares to us
that all our sins are completely forgiven
through the one sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
which he himself accomplished on the cross once for all. [1]

主的晚餐向我们宣明，我们的罪已经完全得赦免，乃是通过耶稣基督在十字架上一次的牺牲完全了救法[1]。

It also declares to us
that the Holy Spirit grafts us into Christ, [2]
who with his true body
is now in heaven at the right hand of the Father [3]
where he wants us to worship him. [4]

这也同样宣明了圣灵已经我们已经将我们接入基督[2]，与祂的真身体一同已经坐在天上，在父的右边[3]，在那里祂需要我们敬拜祂[4]。

But the Mass teaches
that the living and the dead
do not have their sins forgiven
through the suffering of Christ
unless Christ is still offered for them daily by the priests.

It also teaches
that Christ is bodily present
under the form of bread and wine
where Christ is therefore to be worshiped.

Thus the Mass is basically
nothing but a denial
of the one sacrifice and suffering of Jesus Christ
and a condemnable idolatry.

但弥撒教导说，活人死人无法通过基督的受难而得到罪的赦免，除非基督仍然要日常地被神父重新献上。
又教导说，基督的肉身在饼杯之中，因此基督应在此内受敬拜。
所以弥撒本质上是对耶稣基督一次献祭受苦的拒绝，并且是可憎的偶像崇拜。

> In response to a mandate from Synod 1998, the Christian Reformed Church’s Interchurch Relations Committee conducted a study of Q&A 80 and the Roman Catholic Mass. Based on this study, Synod 2004 declared that “Q&A 80 can no longer be held in its current form as part of our confession.” Synod 2006 directed that Q&A 80 remain in the CRC’s text of the Heidelberg Catechism but that the last three paragraphs be placed in brackets to indicate that they do not accurately reflect the official teaching and practice of today’s Roman Catholic Church and are no longer confessionally binding on members of the CRC.

> The Reformed Church in America retains the original full text, choosing to recognize that the catechism was written within a historical context which may not accurately describe the Roman Catholic Church’s current stance.

> 作为对1998年教会会议的决议的回应，基督教改革教会（the Christian Reformed Church, CRC）的教会间关系委员会（Interchurch Relations Committee）指导了对第八十问和罗马天主教弥撒的研究。基于此研究，2004年教会会议宣布第八十问保留在CRC的海德堡教理问答的文本内，但是后三段被置于括号内，以暗示不再准确反映今日罗马天主教会的公开教导和实践，并且也已经不再作为CRC成员的认信约束。

> 在美改革教会（The Reformed Church in America, RCA）保留了初版的全文，选择了认同此教理问答乃是写于历史背景下，并不一定准确表述现在罗马天主教会的状态。

## 第八十一问

Q. Who should come to the Lord’s table?

谁应当到主的桌子前？

---

A. Those who are displeased with themselves
because of their sins,
but who nevertheless trust
that their sins are pardoned
and that their remaining weakness is covered
by the suffering and death of Christ,
and who also desire more and more
to strengthen their faith
and to lead a better life.
Hypocrites and those who are unrepentant, however,
eat and drink judgment on themselves. [1]

那些因自己的罪而痛心，同时相信因着基督的受苦和死，他们的罪已得赦免，他们残留的软弱也已被遮盖的人；
他们也是那切慕日益加强他们的信心以更好的活出来的人。
然而，那些虚伪的人和拒不悔改的人，却不过是吃喝自己的罪。[1]

---

1. 1 Cor. 10:19-22; 11:26-32

## 第八十二问

Q. Should those be admitted
to the Lord’s Supper
who show by what they profess and how they live
that they are unbelieving and ungodly?

那些自己声称、以及他们的生活所显明乃是不信不敬畏神的人，可以被接纳进主的晚餐吗？

---

A. No, that would dishonor God’s covenant
and bring down God’s wrath upon the entire congregation. [1]
Therefore, according to the instruction of Christ
and his apostles,
the Christian church is duty-bound to exclude such people,
by the official use of the keys of the kingdom,
until they reform their lives.

不，这样就亏缺神约的荣耀，叫神的愤怒降在全会众之上[1]。
因此根据基督和祂的使徒所设立的所沿袭的，基督的教会有义务革除这样的人，就是通过公开运用天国的钥匙的权柄，直到他们在生活上显明归正。
