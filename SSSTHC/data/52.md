Q & A 127
Q. What does the sixth petition mean?

A. “And do not bring us to the time of trial,
but rescue us from the evil one” means:

By ourselves we are too weak
to hold our own even for a moment.1
And our sworn enemies—

the devil,2 the world,3 and our own flesh—4

never stop attacking us.

And so, Lord,
uphold us and make us strong

with the strength of your Holy Spirit,

so that we may not go down to defeat

in this spiritual struggle,5

but may firmly resist our enemies

until we finally win the complete victory.6

A. For the kingdom

and the glory are yours forever” means:

We have made all these petitions of you
because, as our all-powerful king,

to give us all that is good;1

and because your holy name,

and not we ourselves,

should receive all the praise, forever.2

Q & A 129
Q. What does that little word “Amen” express?

A. “Amen” means:

This shall truly and surely be!

It is even more sure

that God listens to my prayer

than that I really desire

what I pray for.1
