Q & A 125
Q. What does the fourth petition mean?

A. “Give us this day our daily bread” means:

Do take care of all our physical needs1
so that we come to know

that you are the only source of everything good,2
and that neither our work and worry
nor your gifts
can do us any good without your blessing.3

And so help us to give up our trust in creatures
and trust in you alone.4
