Q & A 99
Q. What is the aim of the third commandment?

A. That we neither blaspheme nor misuse the name of God

by cursing,1 perjury,2 or unnecessary oaths,3

nor share in such horrible sins

by being silent bystanders.4

In summary,

we should use the holy name of God

only with reverence and awe,5

so that we may properly

confess God,6
pray to God,7
and glorify God in all our words and works.8

Q & A 100
Q. Is blasphemy of God’s name by swearing and cursing
really such serious sin
that God is angry also with those
who do not do all they can
to help prevent and forbid it?

A. Yes, indeed.1

No sin is greater
or provokes God’s wrath more
than blaspheming his name.

That is why God commanded it to be punished with death.2

1 Lev. 5:1
2 Lev. 24:10-17
