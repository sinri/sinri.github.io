Q & A 65
Q. It is through faith alone
that we share in Christ and all his benefits:
where then does that faith come from?

A. The Holy Spirit produces it in our hearts1

by the preaching of the holy gospel,2

and confirms it

by the use of the holy sacraments.3

1 John 3:5; 1 Cor. 2:10-14; Eph. 2:8
2 Rom. 10:17; 1 Pet. 1:23-25
3 Matt. 28:19-20; 1 Cor. 10:16

Q & A 66
Q. What are sacraments?

A. Sacraments are visible, holy signs and seals.
They were instituted by God so that

by our use of them

he might make us understand more clearly

the promise of the gospel,

and seal that promise.1

And this is God’s gospel promise:

to grant us forgiveness of sins and eternal life

by grace
because of Christ’s one sacrifice
accomplished on the cross.2

1 Gen. 17:11; Deut. 30:6; Rom. 4:11
2 Matt. 26:27-28; Acts 2:38; Heb. 10:10

Q & A 67
Q. Are both the word and the sacraments then
intended to focus our faith
on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross
as the only ground of our salvation?

A. Yes!
In the gospel the Holy Spirit teaches us
and by the holy sacraments confirms

that our entire salvation
rests on Christ’s one sacrifice for us on the cross.1

1 Rom. 6:3; 1 Cor. 11:26; Gal. 3:27

Q & A 68
Q. How many sacraments
did Christ institute in the New Testament?

A. Two: holy baptism and the holy supper.1

1 Matt. 28:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26
