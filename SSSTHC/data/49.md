Q & A 124
Q. What does the third petition mean?

A. “Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven” means:

Help us and all people

to reject our own wills
and to obey your will without any back talk.
Your will alone is good.1

Help us one and all to carry out the work we are called to,2

as willingly and faithfully as the angels in heaven.3
