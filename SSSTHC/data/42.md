Q & A 110
Q. What does God forbid
in the eighth commandment?

A. God forbids not only outright theft and robbery,

punishable by law.1

But in God’s sight theft also includes
all scheming and swindling
in order to get our neighbor’s goods for ourselves,

whether by force or means that appear legitimate,2
such as

inaccurate measurements of weight, size, or volume;
fraudulent merchandising;
counterfeit money;
excessive interest;
or any other means forbidden by God.3

In addition God forbids all greed4
and pointless squandering of his gifts.5

Q & A 111
Q. What does God require of you
in this commandment?
