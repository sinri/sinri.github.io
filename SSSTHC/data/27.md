# 第27个主日 第二部分 圣浸礼

## 第七十二问

Q. Does this outward washing with water itself wash away sins?

这外在的水洗本身洗去了罪吗？

---

A. No, only Jesus Christ’s blood and the Holy Spirit
cleanse us from all sins. [1]

不，只有基督的血和圣灵才能将我们从罪中洁净[1]。

1. Matt. 3:11; 1 Pet. 3:21; 1 John 1:7

## 第七十三问

Q. Why then does the Holy Spirit call baptism
the water of rebirth and the washing away of sins?

为什么圣灵会把浸礼称为重生的洗和洗去罪？

---

A. God has good reason for these words.
To begin with, God wants to teach us that
the blood and Spirit of Christ take away our sins
just as water removes dirt from the body. [1]
But more important,
God wants to assure us, by this divine pledge and sign,
that we are as truly washed of our sins spiritually
as our bodies are washed with water physically. [2]

神对这些词有着美好的缘由。
首先，神想要教导我们基督的血和灵去除我们的罪，就如同水洗去我们身体的污秽[1]。
更重要的则是，神要给我们确据，通过这神圣的凭据和记号，
我们已经在灵里真实地洗去了我们的罪，
如同我们的身体真实地被水所洗[2]。

## 第七十四问

Q. Should infants also be baptized?

应当为婴儿施行浸礼吗？

---

<del>
A. Yes.
Infants as well as adults
are included in God’s covenant and people, [1]
and they, no less than adults, are promised
deliverance from sin through Christ’s blood
and the Holy Spirit who produces faith. [2]
Therefore, by baptism, the sign of the covenant,
they too should be incorporated into the Christian church
and distinguished from the children of unbelievers. [3]
This was done in the Old Testament by circumcision,[4]
which was replaced in the New Testament by baptism.[5]

是的。

婴儿和成人一样，都被包含在神的约和子民群体之中[1]，
并且他们并不低于成人，也同样被应许了从基督之血和产生信心之圣灵而来的脱离罪恶[2]。
因此，通过浸礼，这约的标记，他们都被归入基督教会并与不信之人的孩童分别[3]。
这在旧约通过割礼完成[4]，在新约则以浸礼代替[5]。

No.
It is not correct to baptise infants.
If the person who is baptised cannot be the witness, the one could not be counted as baptised.
So the baptism done when one did or does not believe is not countable at all.
Only those who can witness the forgiveness of their own sins may be suitable for baptism. [6]
The work done in the water is a witness of what Christ had done that the sins had been washed away. [7]

婴孩受浸的事是不对的。
受浸的人若不能作见证，他就不能算是受浸。
人不信或是没有信的时候受的浸，是靠不住，算不得的。
惟有能见证他知道罪得赦免洗净的人，才有资格受浸[6]。
人在水里所作的，就是见证基督所成功的，见证他的罪已蒙洗净了[7]。
