Q & A 62
Q. Why can’t our good works
be our righteousness before God,
or at least a part of our righteousness?

A. Because the righteousness
which can pass God’s judgment

must be entirely perfect
and must in every way measure up to the divine law.1

But even our best works in this life

are imperfect
and stained with sin.2

1 Rom. 3:20; Gal. 3:10 (Deut. 27:26)
2 Isa. 64:6

Q & A 63
Q. How can our good works
be said to merit nothing
when God promises to reward them
in this life and the next?1

A. This reward is not earned;
it is a gift of grace.2

1 Matt. 5:12; Heb. 11:6
2 Luke 17:10; 2 Tim. 4:7-8

Q & A 64
Q. But doesn’t this teaching
make people indifferent and wicked?

A. No.
It is impossible

for those grafted into Christ through true faith

not to produce fruits of gratitude.1

1 Luke 6:43-45; John 15:5
