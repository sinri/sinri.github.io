Q & A 104
Q. What is God’s will for you
in the fifth commandment?

A. That I honor, love, and be loyal

to my father and mother
and all those in authority over me;

that I submit myself with proper obedience

to all their good teaching and discipline;1

and also that I be patient with their failings—2
for through them God chooses to rule us.3
