Q & A 35
Q. What does it mean that he
“was conceived by the Holy Spirit
and born of the virgin Mary”?

A. That the eternal Son of God,

who is and remains
true and eternal God,1

took to himself,

through the working of the Holy Spirit,2
from the flesh and blood of the virgin Mary,3

a truly human nature

so that he might also become David’s true descendant,4
like his brothers and sisters in every way5

except for sin.6
