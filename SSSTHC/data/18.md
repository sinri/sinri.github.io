## 第四十六问

Q. What do you mean by saying, “He ascended to heaven”?

当你说“祂升天”的时候，是什么意思？

---

A. That Christ, while his disciples watched,
was taken up from the earth into heaven [1]
and remains there on our behalf [2]
until he comes again to judge the living and the dead. [3]

当众门徒观看之时，基督从地上被接上天去[1]，并且为我们的益处留在那里[2]，
直到祂再来，审判活人死人[3]。

## 第四十七问

Q. But isn’t Christ with us until the end of the world as he promised us? [1]

基督岂不也是应许我们说，祂要与我们同在直到世界的末了吗？[1]

---

A. Christ is true human and true God.

基督是真人，也是真神。

In his human nature Christ is not now on earth; [2]
but in his divinity, majesty, grace, and Spirit,
he is never absent from us. [3]

在祂的人性里基督现在不在地上[2]；
但是在祂的神性、权柄、恩典和灵里，祂从未离开我们[3]。

## 第四十八问

Q. If his humanity is not present wherever his divinity is,
then aren’t the two natures of Christ separated from each other?

如果祂的人性并不在祂神性所至的各处，这岂不是说基督的两性是分开的吗？

---

A. Certainly not.

绝对不是。

Since divinity is not limited and is present everywhere, [1]
it is evident that Christ’s divinity is surely beyond the bounds of
the humanity that has been taken on,
but at the same time his divinity is in
and remains personally united to his humanity. [2]

因为神性不能被限制，并且是无所不在[1]，
显然基督的神性是远超于人性所能在的范围，
但是同时祂的神性在于祂的人性，并一直联合于祂的人性[2]。

1. Jer. 23:23-24; Acts 7:48-49 (Isa. 66:1)

## 第四十九问

Q. How does Christ’s ascension to heaven benefit us?

基督的升天如何给我们益处？

---

A. First, he is our advocate in heaven in the presence of his Father. [1]

首先，祂是我们在天上父神面前的代求者[1]。

Second, we have our own flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that Christ our head
will also take us, his members, up to himself. [2]

其次，我们有肉体同在天上的确据，这是因为基督我们的头已经在天，祂也必将我们，就是祂的肢体，提接上天到祂自己那里[2]。

Third, he sends his Spirit to us on earth as a corresponding pledge. [3]
By the Spirit’s power we seek not earthly things but the things above, where Christ is,
sitting at God’s right hand. [4]

第三，祂差遣圣灵到我们这在地之人中间作为相应的凭据[3]。藉着圣灵的能力，我们求地上的事，乃寻求上面的事，那里有基督坐在神的右边[4]。
