Q & A 46
Q. What do you mean by saying,
“He ascended to heaven”?

A. That Christ,

while his disciples watched,

was taken up from the earth into heaven1
and remains there on our behalf2
until he comes again

to judge the living and the dead.3

1 Luke 24:50-51; Acts 1:9-11
2 Rom. 8:34; Eph. 4:8-10; Heb. 7:23-25; 9:24
3 Acts 1:11

Q & A 47
Q. But isn’t Christ with us
until the end of the world
as he promised us?1

A. Christ is true human and true God.

In his human nature Christ is not now on earth;2
but in his divinity, majesty, grace, and Spirit
he is never absent from us.3

1 Matt. 28:20
2 Acts 1:9-11; 3:19-21
3 Matt. 28:18-20; John 14:16-19

Q & A 48
Q. If his humanity is not present
wherever his divinity is,
then aren’t the two natures of Christ
separated from each other?

A. Certainly not.
Since divinity

is not limited
and is present everywhere,1

it is evident that

Christ’s divinity is surely beyond the bounds of

the humanity that has been taken on,

but at the same time his divinity is in
and remains personally united to

his humanity.2

1 Jer. 23:23-24; Acts 7:48-49 (Isa. 66:1)
2 John 1:14; 3:13; Col. 2:9

Q & A 49
Q. How does Christ’s ascension to heaven
benefit us?

A. First, he is our advocate

in heaven
in the presence of his Father.1

Second, we have our own flesh in heaven

as a sure pledge that Christ our head
will also take us, his members,
up to himself.2

Third, he sends his Spirit to us on earth

as a corresponding pledge.3
By the Spirit’s power

we seek not earthly things
but the things above, where Christ is,

sitting at God’s right hand.4

1 Rom. 8:34; 1 John 2:1
2 John 14:2; 17:24; Eph. 2:4-6
3 John 14:16; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 5:5
4 Col. 3:1-4
