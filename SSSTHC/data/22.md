Q. How does the article concerning “life everlasting” comfort you?

信条里的“永生”是如何安慰你的？

A. Even as I already now experience in my heart the beginning of eternal joy,[1]
so after this life I will have perfect blessedness such as
no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no human heart has ever imagined:
a blessedness in which to praise God forever. [2]

到我此生结束之后，我将要经历完美的福乐，乃是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见，心里也未曾想到过的，乃是在那里要永远赞美神[2]。
