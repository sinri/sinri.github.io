Q & A 57
Q. How does “the resurrection of the body”
comfort you?

A. Not only will my soul

be taken immediately after this life
to Christ its head,1

but also my very flesh will be

raised by the power of Christ,
reunited with my soul,
and made like Christ’s glorious body.2

1 Luke 23:43; Phil. 1:21-23
2 1 Cor. 15:20, 42-46, 54; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2

Q & A 58
Q. How does the article
concerning “life everlasting”
comfort you?

A. Even as I already now

experience in my heart
the beginning of eternal joy,1

so after this life I will have

perfect blessedness such as

no eye has seen,
no ear has heard,
no human heart has ever imagined:

a blessedness in which to praise God forever.2

1 Rom. 14:17
2 John 17:3; 1 Cor. 2:9
