Q. What do you believe
concerning “the Holy Spirit”?

A. First, that the Spirit, with the Father and the Son,

is eternal God.1

Second, that the Spirit is given also to me,2

so that, through true faith,
he makes me share in Christ and all his benefits,3
comforts me,4
and will remain with me forever.5
