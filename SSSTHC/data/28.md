# 第28个主日 第二部分 耶稣基督的神圣晚餐

## 第七十五问

Q. How does the holy supper remind and assure you
that you share in Christ’s one sacrifice on the cross
and in all his benefits?

这神圣的晚餐是如何提醒并保证你有份于基督在十字架上一次的牺牲、并祂全部的益处？

---

A. In this way:
Christ has commanded me and all believers
to eat this broken bread and to drink this cup
in remembrance of him.
With this command come these promises: [1]

基督已经命令我和所有的相信之人，要吃这擘开的饼并喝这杯，为的是记念祂。
伴随此命令而来的是以下应许[1]：

First,
as surely as I see with my eyes
the bread of the Lord broken for me
and the cup shared with me,
so surely
his body was offered and broken for me
and his blood poured out for me
on the cross.

首先，如我眼见般确实，这主为我擘开的饼并这杯已经与我有份，
同样，在十字架上，祂的身体已经为我赐下并擘开，
祂的血也为我倾倒而出。

Second,
as surely as
I receive from the hand of the one who serves,
and taste with my mouth
the bread and cup of the Lord,
given me as sure signs of Christ’s body and blood,
so surely
he nourishes and refreshes my soul for eternal life
with his crucified body and poured-out blood.

其次，正如我从会众之手接过并亲尝以口，这给我的主的饼和杯是基督的身体和血的显然记号，
祂也同样以祂被钉的身体和倾倒出的宝血确实地喂养并更新我的灵魂以致永生。

## 第七十六问

Q. What does it mean
to eat the crucified body of Christ
and to drink his poured-out blood?

吃基督被钉的身体和喝祂倾倒出的血是什么意思？

---

A. It means
to accept with a believing heart
the entire suffering and death of Christ
and thereby
to receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life. [1]

这表明，以相信的心接受基督完全的受难和死，并因而接受赦罪和永生。[1]

But it means more.
Through the Holy Spirit, who lives both in Christ and in us,
we are united more and more to Christ’s blessed body. [2]

但这也表明，通过住在基督和我们里面的圣灵，我们越过越联于基督蒙福的身体。[2]

And so, although he is in heaven [3] and we are on earth,
we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. [4]

并且，虽然祂在高天[3]而我们在地上，我们是祂骨中的骨，也是祂肉中的肉[4]。

And we forever live on and are governed by one Spirit,
as the members of our body are by one soul. [5]

并且我们要永远活着，接受一灵的管治，正如我们身体的肢体受我们一灵魂的管治[5]，

## 第七十七问

Q. Where does Christ promise
to nourish and refresh believers
with his body and blood
as surely as
they eat this broken bread
and drink this cup?

基督在何处应许要以祂的身体和血喂养并更新相信的人，正如他们吃这擘开的饼、喝这杯一样确实？

A. In the institution of the Lord’s Supper:
“The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed
took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks,
he broke it and said,
‘This is my body that is [broken] [3] for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.’
In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying,
‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood,
Do this, as often as you drink it,
in remembrance of me.’
For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
you proclaim the Lord’s death
until he comes.” [1]

This promise is repeated by Paul in these words:
“The cup of blessing that we bless,
is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ?
The bread that we break,
is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body,
for we all partake of the one bread.” [2]

在设立主的晚餐时：

> “主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开说：‘这是我的身体，为你们舍的；你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。’饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：‘这杯是用我的血所立的新约；你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。’你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。” [1]

使徒保罗反复重申这一应许，说：

> “我们所祝福的杯，岂不是同领基督的血吗？我们所擘开的饼，岂不是同领基督的身体吗？我们虽多，仍是一个饼，一个身体；因为我们都是分受这一个饼。” [2]
