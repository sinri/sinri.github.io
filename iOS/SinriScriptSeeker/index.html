			Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD: And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it. (Amos 8:11-12)

			Sinri Script Seeker originally was designed to search keyword in the Script as the first application of my Apple Developer account. It is free according to my principle that "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's", which addressed by the LORD Jesus Christ.
		</p>
		<p>
			This application is now available on Add Store for any iOS device. Any one can download it for free and use it for his own search work. In general, the user is expected to prepare the source script, and take responsibility for the issue on copyright and any other. Two sample provided here to show the target format of the source file for line-based script search. The basic rule is that, make the first phrase of one line as index, such as "John-3:16", and with the verse text "For God so loved the world..." put one space in between. Well, download the sample to check more. Even if your source text is not in such format, the app would work as well, only a little inconvenience for viewing.
		</p>
		<p>
			So here are the sample source texts. After your install job, download the provided scripts, and import them into SinriScriptSeeker through iTunes:
			<a href="BibleUCV.txt">Bible of Chinese Union Version</a> and
			<a href="KJV1611Entire.txt">Bible of King James Version 1611 Edition</a>.
			Of course the two are just samples. You can set up any documents in UTF-8 encoding and make each line formatted as "INDEX CONTENT", such as "Genesis-1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.".
