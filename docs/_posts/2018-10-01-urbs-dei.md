# 2018.10.01 Urbs Dei 

```
I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love;
The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

And there's another country, I've heard of long ago,
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.

-- I Vow to Thee, My Country, 1921, Sir Cecil Spring Rice

Now the nation is coming to its one more anniversary.
From a nation poor and chaotic, to an earthly strong existence among the nations.
The glory of the old empires has been recoveried.
The sky, the land, and the sea, controlled by our force.
All the hearts of the citizens, taught to cry hail.
A giant stand on the east Asia, the huge panda now faces the eagle oversea.

This is a nation holding the ideal to stand independent.
The kings and the lords, all noblemen, called to keep one heart.
A peaceful society and a stable infrastructure, years to be still.
All mouths with other languages should be sealed.
All pens with shrill should be locked.
All houses with steeple should be shadowed by the bloody symbolism.

The nation now stands still, no enemies can break its defense.
From the eastern sea to the southern reefs our ships swim.
From the northern snow to western plateau our cannons await.
The power and force, so great, with confidence we enjoy.
Iron or soil, no matter which, it is built hard and mega.
Now who would think about a stone was cut out without hands.

Amongst the ten tribes in the days of Ahab, seventy thousand were hidden.
When the dragon breathes out fires with hot winds shall they stand.
One nation and one dominion, over all earthly existence be.
Back on which they should fight for the name of their master.
Once a baby put in a manger, one crucified at the lowest class.
Now the Lord of Hosts be, with a rod of iron to rule.

Over all visible power, the authority to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Changeth the times and the seasons, removeth kings, and setteth up kings.
With suffering we win the victory, with love we enjoy the everlasting life.
Our faith once shone under the butcher knives with the blood of martyrs.
The buildings teared down as their dynasties, the books fired as their corpses.
Behold, the carnival of the dragon, the beast and the false prophet.

Uzziah the great, with a censer in his hand, went into the house.
Where the Azariah and the valiant men in the present days are.
But they have no power and strength, fired and persecuted.
In their blood the visitor stepped forward, with worth and arrogance.
Alas, leprous was seen, the evidence was known of being smitten.
May the sons of the nation study and know where the gate is.
