AUTHOR: Watchman Nee

COMPOSER: Lowell Mason

```
1	When war is hot and fierce,
	And Satan strong,
	Then firmly trust God’s Word
	And sing faith’s song.
2	You need to shout but once,
	And you will win;
	Oh, do not shut your mouth
	And lose therein.
3	If pressed your spirit is
	And powerless,
	Pray thru the precious blood,
	Victorious.
4	The foe though fierce, you can
	Still fight with him;
	If you will keep your stand,
	You soon will win.
5	Therefore you must declare
	Christ’s victory;
	The situation dark
	Soon changed will be.
