## Introduction

Are you now using Numbered Musical Notation? It is used widely among Local Churches in China Mainland for hymnal as it is easy to learn and remember, even old sisters who know nothing about staff could follow the melody with it after several weeks in Church. For piano players, it provides a wider creative room to generate the music, rather than lock the two hands to an absolute method. Anyway, thatâ€™s all the background information. Actually, on many occasions, a common person cannot determine the melody without an instrument or sample music. This project is for you, if you are worrying about how to sing a numbered musical notation correctly without any instrument nor sample music, or you just cannot play music freely. Just type the notation! The App makes you the midi file, and play it for you!
