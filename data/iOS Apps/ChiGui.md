## General

ChiGui is an application running on iOS devices, providing a platform of drawing geometry graphs with straight lines and circles, a.k.a. Compass-and-straightedge construction (or ruler-and-compass construction or classical construction), is the construction of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures using only an idealized ruler and compass.

## Feature

It provides methods to draw points, lines, circles. For assistant, you can select possible key point from computed results, and transfer distance to draw circle which is proved possible.

You can also save workspace and open again to continue your work. To share your work with others is also a possible choise. All your construction history would be recorded, and would become the content if you use mail to send your work.
